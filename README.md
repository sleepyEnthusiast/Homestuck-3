This is a mod for minecraft fabric 1.20.4 inspired by the webcomic Homestuck and the forge mod Minestuck. 

Development is done soley by me, and this is my first minecraft mod, so expect the worst and lemme know how to improve.

Current goal is to implement the grist and alchemy system then release that as a v1 proof of concept. This is because im scared of doing biome and world generation, as is any modder who isnt insane.
